exchange-sim
============

A stock exchange simulator skeleton intended to allow multiple clients to interact and compete using various algorithms in real-time. The environment will be seeded with market makers and AI traders, as well as 'events' (news) which will create changes in the market.

Initially intended to be a "Yodle Dev Challenge," other priorities never allowed me to get it up and running.

An IntelliJ IDEA 9 project file is included to build and test.
